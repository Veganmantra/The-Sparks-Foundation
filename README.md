Internship - Data Science and Business Analytics Internship
Duration - 1 Month ( June 2021 ) 
Internship Type - Work from Home 
Information- In this internship, we were provided a total of 8 Tasks.

Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)


From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. Use R or Python or perform this task. Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j

Task-3 : To Explore Business Analytics (Level - Beginner )
Please click on the images on right side to view my solution (preferably youtube).

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel) Dataset link :https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl Create storyboards. Screen record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations

Task- 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’. As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA? You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5. Create storyboards. Screen-record along with 
your audio explaining the charts and interpretations. Use images.

Task -5 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’. As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors 
contributing win or loss of a team. Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products. You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b. Create storyboards. Screen-record along with your audio 
explaining the charts and interpretations. Use annotations, animation and 
images.

Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task-7 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)
Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines. Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX). Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com. Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6 Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model
